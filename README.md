An ongoing personal project to practice my coding skills and learn QT. 
This is inspired by a class project I did in my junior year of college that never saw completion (or much functionality at all). 
Based heavily on the D&D Beyond character builder. I use the [DnD API] (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/). 
This is in stop/start development. I am currently working on functionality for selecting Ability Score Values.
